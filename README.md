# Pong

I learned some JavaScript and Three.js in a couple of days for an interview process. I did not want to watch any Pong code and figure it out by myself.
Overall, it went pretty well, but the structure of the code is not on point. My sceneManager class is doing too much, and i would have liked to decentrelized such as in a 
MVC pattern. Maybe i take the project further by separating the game logic and the three.js part. Probably using this cool reference https://discoverthreejs.com/book/first-steps/animation-loop/. This would allow a nice GameMenu which is not present at the moment. Refresh to replay :)
